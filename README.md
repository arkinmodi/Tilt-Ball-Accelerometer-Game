# Tilt Ball Accelerometer Game

Assignment 7 for SFWRENG 4HC3 - Human Computer Interfaces

## Overview

This is an accelerometer based game where the objective is to move the player (i.e., the green ball) into the goal (i.e., the black square). This game utilizes the HTML Canvas and the device's accelerometer. The player's movement speed is based on the intensity of the tilt and movement is bounded to the canvas area. There is a running count of how many times the player has won.

## How To Run

To play, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The web browser will need to support HTML Canvas. If playing on a device without an accelerometer, developer tools will be needed to add this functionality. In Google Chrome, Orientation can be found under Chrome DevTools > Sensors.
